## Healthcare Risk Factors Analysis

### *Group Members*
Luc Delas, Ania Krawiec, Fleur Smith, Joel Straker

### *Project Summary*
This project explores how demographic, lifestyle, and medical risk factors relate to major health conditions using a synthetic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to identify meaningful patterns and develop simple predictive models that help explain disease risk.

### *Dataset Information*
* Dataset: "Healthcare Risk Factors" (synthetic dataset from Kaggle)
* Downloaded using:
    import kagglehub
    path = kagglehub.dataset_download(“abdallaahmed77/healthcare-risk-factors-dataset”)
* This dataset includes the variables:
    * Demographic variables (age, gender)
    * Lifestyle habits (smoking, alcohol, physical activity, diet, sleep, stress)
    * Medical risk indicators (BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol, glucose, oxygen saturation, triglycerides, HbA1C, family history)
    * Major health conditions (hypertension, diabetes, obesity, asthma, arthritis, cancer, healthy)

### *Research Question*
How do demographic, lifestyle, and medical risk factors individually and jointly influence the likelihood of developing major health conditions within a synthetic dataset, and how can these relationships be used to prototype predictive tools?
